# Chagotchi

This game is my take on the classic *Tamagotchi* game!

Watch your chao enjoy the days growing up in *Chao Garden* along with its buddies!

## Objective
 Try to keep your chao alive during this fast paced version. The goal is to keep the *Hunger*, *Energy* and *Happiness* bars from **hitting 10**; by pressing the corresponding buttons. However, do not over press the buttons or you will **kill your chao!**
